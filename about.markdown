My name's Ross. I'm a 32 year old man living in Manchester, UK. For the last 3 and a half years, I've worked for the Co-op in their Supply Chain department. I studied History at the University of Manchester as an undergrad, and then I got a Masters degree from the University of York in Politics, Philosophy & Economics.

I love reading. Most kinds of books, mainly fiction. I also love music, films, and good quality TV. I plan to post some thoughts about things which I've enjoyed. I'm also interested in politics and philosophy, so I might post the odd thing on these subjects too.

A few years ago, despite having no technical background, I stumbled across computer programming and found to my surprise that it was something which interested me. In the last couple of years, I've focused primarily on learning front end technologies in my free time. I've built some projects of my own, which you can find <a href="https://ross117.github.io/">here</a>.

For the last few years I've been learning French. When I started I didn't know much beyond a few basic phrases, but I took classes and now I've got a B2 qualification.
