My name's Ross. I'm a 32 year old man living in Manchester, UK. I work in the Supply Chain department of the Co-op, which has food shops all over the country. I studied History at the University of Manchester as an undergrad, and then I got a Masters degree from the University of York in Politics, Philosophy & Economics.

A few years ago, I stumbled across computer programming. In the last couple of years, I've particularly focused on learning front end technologies in my free time. I've built some projects of my own, which you can find <a href="https://ross117.github.io/">here</a>.

For the last few years I've been learning French. When I started I didn't know much beyond a few basic phrases, but I took classes and now and I've got a B2 qualification.

I love reading. Most kinds of books, mainly fiction. I also love music, films, and good quality TV.
