<!-- When did I get into computer programming & why? -->

For a long time, until I was in my late 20s, I didn't make much effort to engage with technology despite living in a society that was becoming increasingly digitised. There's an Italian film called *The Consequences of Love* in which the main character rebukes a bank employee who proposes using a machine instead of people to count his money by telling him that we "should never lose our faith in our fellow human beings." **(check quote, also: maybe just showing off)** I'm not sure that I had this exact principle in mind, but I certainly wasn't particularly interested in the new possibilities of instant communication and time efficiencies offered by the the latest apps. I also wasn't into gaming and I didn't own any technical hardware other than the basics (and outdated models at that). For all of my life up to that point, I would have classed myself as a 'humanities' type of person. I studied History and Politics at university, and I love the arts; reading novels is a big part of my life.

Given this, how and why did I become so interested in and excited about computer programming that I spent many hours of my free time working through tutorials, going to projects and attending tech meetups in Manchester? The spark, and much of the motivation, was provided by my employment circumstances at the time. I had completed a Masters degree in 2011, after which followed a long and sickeningly (or grindingly?) depressing period of unemployment followed by boring, unchallenging job doing data entry. I desperately needed something to stretch and occupy my mind. The first thing I turned to was learning another language, something which I'd wanted to do for a long time without properly getting round to it. I started taking French classes at my local Alliance Francaise **(special character)** But I was still in search of a meaningful career; I aspired to loving what I did. My introduction to computer programming came from working alongside a team which wrote VBA scripts to automate Internet Explorer for data entry purposes.
